What the Script Does
* Reads all files in a directory (recursively)
* Converts filenames to lowercase and removes the extension
* Compares files by name (without extension) and size
* Reports possible duplicates

| Original Issue                         | Improved In This Script         |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Inefficient nested find commands       | Single scan using `find`        |
| Case-sensitive name match              | Converts names to lowercase     |
| Multiple redundant checks              | Uses Bash associative arrays    |
| Poor handling of filenames with spaces | Uses `-print0` and `IFS` safely |
